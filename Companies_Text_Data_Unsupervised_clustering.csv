Gruppo Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane,"The parent company Ferrovie dello Stato SpA is 100% owned by the Italian Ministry of Economics and Finance, and controls the operating companies in the four industrial sectors: transport, infrastructure, real estate services and other services. All the companies nevertheless maintain their own company characteristics and are run autonomously in pursuing their respective business objectives.

Ferrovie dello Stato SpA, while leaving the autonomous legal responsibilities of the companies in which it holds shares unchanged, mainly carries out company type activity which is typical of a holding company (management of the subsidiaries, share ownership, etc..), as well as industrial type work. Through a system of Central Directorates, the parent company also sets strategic approaches and ensures the orientation and the coordination of the industrial policies of the operational companies.

Leader in passenger rail transport, with 88% market share, and freight, with 7%, the FS Italiane Group has about 74,200 employees, 8,000 trains running per day, more than 830 million passengers per year, and 50 million tonnes of goods per year. The railway network includes over 16,700 km of tracks, of which about 1,000 km are dedicated to high-speed services.

The FS Italiane Group aims to become the enterprise system that implements integrated and sustainable mobility and logistics services by exploiting synergistic transport infrastructures, thus creating value in Italy and abroad. In 2016, the FS Italiane Group confirmed its excellent performance, achieved over the past years, by reaching impressive financial results and profits of €772 million, never before achieved by the company.

On 1st December 2016, the CEO of the Gruppo Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane Renato Mazzoncini was unanimously elected as President of the Union Internationale des Chemins de fer (UIC), the association which represents the railway sector at a global level. The election recognises the commitment of the group in developing the railway sector and the ability to best represent its interests. It also means an important milestone for the Italian system, which will have the chance to influence the creation of transport policies at a global level, in one of the most strategic industries for investment and in terms of the impact it has on people and a country's economy. The UIC will also be called upon to play the vital role of consultant and advisor for the large investment programmes which are currently under way, or are scheduled for the next few years around the world: from the TEN-T European corridors (passengers and freight) to China, the US, India and Russia.

Another important stage in the renewal process has been the introduction of the new Busitalia Fast service, which was presented in April in Berlin on the occasion of the sector's international trade fair Bus2Bus 2017. It offers competitive transport services at a domestic and European level, with high levels of safety and innovation. Created with the aim of becoming the main European player in long-distance mobility by bus, the service runs daily service to 15 Italian regions and over 90 cities in Italy and Germany, with a fleet of 60 latest-generation buses.

And then during 2017, the FS Italiane group's rail freight transport and logistics services changed radically with the launch of the Polo Mercitalia, a single, large hub that brings together the group companies that operate in this area (Mercitalia Logistics, Mercitalia Rail, Gruppo TX Logistik, Mercitalia Intermodal, Mercitalia Transport & Services, Mercitalia Shunting & Terminal, TerAlp and TLF).

On 29 December 2017, Anas joined the FS Italiane Group, contributing to the establishment of the first integrated rail and road hub in Europe for serving residents and investing €108 billion over the next ten years.

However, the FS Group doesn't just limit itself to national borders. As the number one European railway company for profitability, the Company exports Made in Italy excellence for the development of railway networks all over the world: the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, the Balkans, Latin America, USA, India, and Australia.

Regal Homes was a great opportunity to learn all facets of custom home construction.

Bud Regal was a well seasoned builder with almost 40 years of general construction knowledge who took Paul under his wing and taught him everything about building a house from the ground up. In 1998 Paul moved to California looking to get a piece of the real-estate boom and took a job with ERI one of the premier environmental remediation companies, who at that time were involved in retrofitting gas stations for Tosco (76 Oil) and Exxon/Mobil. This was part of an endowment program mandated by the President to change steel under ground storage tanks (UST’s), into double wall fiberglass UST’s, as a prevention from leaking fuel into ground water tables. The environmental clean up business was a great opportunity to see the commercial side of construction and learn many trades like concrete finishing, soil engineering, pipe fitting, soldering, welding, heavy equipment and commercial development. 

For the next several years Paul spent most of his time working in general construction and going to school to learn real estate law and economics and then in 2004 he started working with Safeguard Real Estate Investments and quickly became their No. 1 real-estate investment consultant and was promoted to Director of Business Development.",United States,2007-01-01,2

Zigtag,"Zigtag is an intelligent, semantic, social bookmarking service. The Zigtag sidebar provides both an intuitive way of tagging web pages (using descriptive words or phrases) and a user-friendly way of quickly retrieving tagged pages.
 
Users tag web pages with semantic tags (tags which have definitions) e.g. if you tag a page with ""Apple"" you can choose ""Apple (computer company)"", ""Apple (fruit)"", ""Apple (record label)"" etc.  Pages can be retrieved using any of the tags which were previously entered or using synonyms for those tags, e.g. a page tagged with ""Car"" can be retrieved by searching for pages tagged with ""Car"" or ""Automobile"" (Zigtag understands Car and Automobile are the same). This allows you to:
 * Keep your tag space organized — you don't end up with ""New_York,"" ""New-York"" and ""NewYork"" — Zigtag has only one ""New York (the city)"" (although you can search for using ""NY,"" ""NYC"" or even ""Big Apple"")
 * Search for your bookmarks quickly and efficiently — the type-ahead helps you choose from tags you've used and also shows their definitions
 * Find what others have tagged effectively — no confusion between ""Stock (soup base),"" ""Stock (equities)"" or ""Stock (inventory)""
 
Zigtag also has a major social networking component; you can see what your friends are tagging and create and join special interest groups. The sidebar notifies you when your friends tag something new, and a news feed allows you to see what your friends are tagging at a glance. It's kind of a ""personal Digg""—your friends' interesting sites are likely to be interesting to you.

BottleMark,"BottleMark uses digital printing to make custom bottle caps in small quantities, where existing processes required mass production (on the order of half a million.)

BottleMark brings the digital print-on-demand revolution to bottle caps (with other products, like labels, carriers, corks, and jar lids likely in the future.) The printing and fulfillment process is designed to make very small orders, even down to one bottle cap, economical. BottleMark has no minimum order, and no tiered pricing; shipping is the only factor encouraging larger orders, and even that is carefully minimized. This is in amazing contrast to the traditional bottle cap manufacturing process, which has a typical minimum order of a half-million caps, and also requires lithographic plate creation.

The BottleMark website features a hand-coded ""design tool"" to upload, place, size, and order bottle caps. It works on all major browsers. A future version will be based on SVG and allow greater capabilities.

Bottle caps are used by home brewers and breweries in bulk, but are also popular in crafts and scrapbooking, as well as jewelry and other decorations. They also make interesting and inexpensive promotional items.",United States,2010-11-08,1

Concrete is cheap, resilient and abundant, however its high carbon footprint is preventing it from being the preferred building material to supply the rapid global shift to green construction practices. Concrete, despite all of its desirable attributes, is losing market share to other ‘perceived’ green materials. CarbonCure helps to solve this pain, with its proprietary technologies and value-added services. It offers concrete producers the ability to manufacture green concrete products without compromising on either quality or price.

CarbonCure is a retrofit innovation that repurposes CO2 gas from large final emitters as a feedstock in concrete plants. The gas is permanently converted into embedded solid mineral carbonates that yield material, environmental and production advantages. By enabling concrete manufacturers to consume CO2 into concrete products during manufacturing, the technology differentiates an otherwise traditional commodity concrete product, while achieving superior material performance characteristics. In addition to technology, CarbonCure provides demand-pull marketing and environmental reporting/certification services to reinforce our customers’ exclusive competitive positioning. The technology is licensed at a very low-CAPEX to concrete producers, generating a recurring revenue stream.",Canada,2007-06-01,0

Although carriers with fleets of 20 trucks or less make up over 92% of all trucking companies in the United States, they must compete with larger fleets without the benefit of the premium-priced software tools and economies of scale savings available to their more resourced competitors. Thus, many carriers juggle multiple software subscriptions and/or manual processes to carry out their day-to-day fleet and business operations. Synthesizing the various outputs from separate tools costs small business owners time and money that could be better utilized elsewhere.

Solution:
Truckish’s Fleet Management Solution saves carriers time and money by integrating the tools they need into a comprehensive SaaS system that is affordable to the average trucking company. These tools include dispatch, vehicle diagnostics, tracking and maintenance, ELD and Hours of Service compliance, IFTA calculations, contacts management, and accounting with easy integration to QuickBooks and payroll systems. 

Carriers use the Truckish web platform to manage their customers, team, and assets. Our automated workflow seamlessly facilitates every load from dispatch through to invoicing and driver payroll. Drivers connect to the platform via the Truckish mobile app, where they monitor their assignments, track their hours of service, and manage load documentation and contacts. And with Truckish plug and play hardware installed in their trucks, carriers can view real time data and diagnostics on their vehicles while maintaining compliance with the latest government ELD mandate.

Truckish streamlines carriers’ operations, increasing their productivity and reducing their overhead, so that trucking companies can focus on growing their businesses.",United States,2017-07-26,2

With both FedEx and UPS launching rate hikes and dimension based pricing, we believe the time is right for a widely popular alternative, specifically Barnacle.

Thermo Tech Technologies,"Thermo Tech™ Technologies Inc. (""Thermo Tech™"" or ""the Company"") is a publicly traded Company (symbol: TTRIF), which trades on the NASD OTC Bulletin Board. The Company is registered in the Yukon, Canada, and has traded in the public market since 1987.

Thermo Tech™ holds the patents to a unique organic waste conversion technology and has developed turnkey commercial designs for its Thermo Master™ Plants, which can be delivered anywhere in the world, operating at capacities of up to 1200 tons per day receiving. One such facility is the Company's flagship Hamilton Bio Conversion Inc. Thermo Master™ Mark III plant, located in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. The Mark III technology is covered by patents recently granted in the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia with 14 more pending and in the final stages of approval under the Patent Cooperation Treaty protocol for international patents.

Thermo Tech™ licenses each plant for the use of its Thermo Master™ technology and also grants master licenses to capable firms, for exclusive territories. Through construction, ownership and operation of its own plants and the efforts of master license holders to construct and operate Thermo Master™ plants elsewhere, the Company has plans to roll out a large number of its unique facilities throughout the world.

The Thermo Master™ technology converts organic materials normally designated as wastes suitable only for disposal, into useful end products such as animal feed ingredients and fertilizers. It does so rapidly, in a matter of hours, by employing high temperature aerobic (oxygen loving) microbes. The high temperatures eliminate pathogenic (disease causing) bacteria and other microbes as well as any other noxious inclusions such as insect eggs or larvae. The thermophilic (heat loving) organisms that carry out the process improve the overall nutrient profile of the end product, which is then dried to a stable pellet, easy to handle, transport and use.

The Company owns a number of private subsidiary firms, which conduct the various phases of its business. It has contractual license agreements with other firms capable of building and operating plants. Finally, Thermo Tech™ has specific service agreements with Planet Earth Operating Services Inc. that support it in the normal conduct of business in North America and elsewhere. The most notable of these is a comprehensive service agreement, which covers North American operations, freeing Thermo Tech™ management to concentrate in the short term on launching its business in Southeast Asia, through its Firmaplus subsidiary.",Malaysia,1987-01-01,0

Carasti,"Carasti is an app where you can subscribe to a car and have the flexibility to switch when you like. The days of being locked into a long term loan, lease or overpriced rental are over. 

We live in a world where the sharing economy, on demand and subscription culture is taking over. We have seen this with music (Spotify), movies (Netflix), books (Scribd), hotels (AirBnB) etc. When it comes to cars, things have really not moved too much for the past 100 years however the difference today is that we have much more accessible transportation options and therefore cars, instead of being the symbol of ultimate freedom are seen as a depreciating burden. In fact, buying a car today means spending lots of money and time on many disjointed services such as insurance, roadside assistance, maintenance, tax & registration.

Because of this by 2025 more than 50% of car owners today will not want to own a car (KPMG) & customers are demanding more flexible renting and leasing options as well as leveraging other more convenient access to mobility such as Uber (on demand ride hailing) and Lime (kick scooter).

The reality is that customers are shifting towards an access and not ownership model therefore our value proposition is a flexible low barrier to entry for consumers to access a car and a way for dealerships, rental & leasing companies to substantially increase revenue and tap into the growing trend of the subscription model culture.",United Kingdom,2019-01-30,1

FastBuild,"FastBuild is a construction system that allows buildings to be constructed faster at a lower cost and with higher quality than traditional systems.  It is ideally suited for villa construction and high rise buildings.  There are two manufactured components: lightweight concrete blocks and pre-stressed t-beams.   We have invested in equipment, licenses and inventory and are seeking additional capital of $800,000 to establish a commercial scale factory in the Gulf region that will produce two villas per week.  

There is overwhelming demand for the our products in the Gulf region, and to secure a portion of this we need to expand production capacity and add equipment to upgrade from the pilot scale mobile factory we already own to a fully functioning factory.  

Investors capital can be fully repaid from a project of only 50 villas, or only six months of production.  To enable installation of our system, we have partnered with a 600+ person, Canadian owned construction company that is able to execute projects of any size.  

Quality labour supply is a key issue in the Gulf construction industry.  Labour productivity is significantly higher with FastBuild so total labour requirements can be 60% less.   Speed of construction is a primary selling feature of the FastBuild system.  Whereas a project of 30 villas may take 18 months to complete, the same project with FastBuild could be completed in 12 months.  This represents a tremendous savings in overhead and dramatically improves return on invested capital.   FastBuild blocks can be used for partition walls, and in this case the savings are excellent => 17-24%.   Pre-stressed t-beams generate a savings of 20% in direct costs and are much faster to built floors with than casting a concrete slab.",Canada,2014-01-01,1
